## Project Motivation

**Data analytics** has become a key component in driving decision-making to optimize performance in professional football organizations according to the survey, that explores the characteristics of the data analytics infrastructure across various national federations and professional clubs. The survey also highlights the underemployment of staff with expertise in applied data analytics and general resourcing limitations as major constraints to getting meaningful insights from raw data in professional football organizations.

The field of **Generative Artificial Intelligence** (AI) has given birth to **Large Language Models** (LLMs), also known as **Foundational Models** (FMs), such as **GPT** and **Claude**, that are being used as powerful general-purpose agents for building new AI applications with the ability to perform tasks that require flexible reasoning and planning.

The recent advancements in **Generative AI** has ushered Technology into a new era but solving problems with an agent in a reliable way often requires the agent to be a compound system with multiple components instead of a single query to the model. The agent also requires access to external tools such as search engines, code interpreters and database queries as well as domain-specific manual tuning. A new research has been formulated known as **Automated Design of Agentic Systems** (ADAS) with the aim of automating novel building blocks and designing powerful agentic systems.

The overarching _goal of the project is to build a compound agentic system using open-source language models_ like **Llama 3.1** released by **Meta AI** to automate data analysis and reporting for performance analysis in soccer. This will serve as a solution to the constraints faced by professional football organizations in turning raw data into meaningful insights to gain a competitive advantage on the field of play.

The potential impact of research and project completion is as follows:

- **Data-Driven Decisions:** The project will empower football organizations with automated data-driven insights leading to informed decisions in Performance Analysis to gain competitive advantage on and off the field.

- **Resource Optimization:** Using automation in Performance Analysis alleviates the need for hiring a team of Data Analytics Experts, allowing organizations with financial constraints to still access key insights for improvement.

- **Accessibility:** The use of open source language models and technologies will make the AI Data Analyst more accessible and scalable across different levels of football orgnaizations from small clubs to national federations.

- **Innovation in Sports Analytics:** The project will contribute to the broader field of sports technology by integrating/embedding AI at the core of data analytics to further advance how technology is used in professional sports.

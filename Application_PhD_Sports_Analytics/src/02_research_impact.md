title: Potential Impact
---

The potential impact of research and project completion is as follows:

- **Data-Driven Decisions:** The project will empower football organizations with automated data-driven insights leading to informed decisions in Performance Analysis to gain competitive advantage on and off the field.

- **Resource Optimization:** Using automation in Performance Analysis alleviates the need for hiring a team of Data Analytics Experts, allowing organizations with financial constraints to still access key insights for improvement.

- **Accessibility:** The use of open source language models and technologies will make the AI Data Analysis Agentic System more accessible and scalable across different levels of football orgnaizations from small clubs to national federations.

- **Innovation in Sports Analytics:** The project will contribute to the broader field of sports technology by integrating/embedding AI at the core of data analytics to further advance how technology is used in professional sports.

## Dataset

The data to be used for analysis -> *event data/play-by-play data*.

## Technology Stack

**Backend:** Python, SQL, Supabase

**Frontend:** HTML, CSS, Next.js

## Research Challenges

- **Integrating Open-Source Language Models:** Successfully incorporating open-source language models, like Llama 3.1, into the system will require a thorough understanding of their architecture, capabilities, and limitations. This challenge is compounded by the need to fine-tune these models to handle domain-specific tasks in soccer performance analysis.

- **Ensuring System Reliability and Scalability:** Building a reliable and scalable compound agentic system requires careful design and testing. This includes managing data pipelines, ensuring efficient model deployment, and maintaining system performance as data volume and complexity increase.

## Skill Development Challenges

- Learning Next.js Framework for building modern web applications.

- Enhancing Frontend Development Skills to create a generative User Interface(UI) and a great User Experience(UX).
